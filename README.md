# Oura JSON to Runalyze

This script allows you to extract your json data from the JSON file provided by Oura.

For those people who are using an oura ring but not paying for a premium subscription, therefore are unable to use the API, this allows an easier way to import data into Runalyze rather than manually copying and pasting the data.

You need to create your own config.json file with your personal token.

In the future I'd like to add an interface so you can just drop the json file and it'll handle it but for now you need to manually add the json into the data folder and specify the address in the code.
